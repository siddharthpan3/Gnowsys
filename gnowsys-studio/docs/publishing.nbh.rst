Publishing Neighbourhood as a Semantic Blog
===========================================

For each node of the semantic network, we generate the neighbourhood
of each node as a hyperlinked content object in HTML, an image in
hyperlinked nodes in an SVG image format and as an RDF graph. 

Based on the examples given, developers can represent the graphs in
they way they like.
