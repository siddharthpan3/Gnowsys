We will support CG, CGIF, Common Logic, CLIF, and controlled natural
language representations of knowledge.  If any of you would like to
contribute these modules, we will be more than happy to collaborate
with you.  Please write about your interest to <glab@gnowledge.org>,
or join us to talk to our team in the mailing list or jabber
conference room.  We hang around in the room `glab` at
conference.jabber.org.
